          Being Geeky is one of the best platform for the online learning. With
          the best study material.Dummy text is text that is used in the
          publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which will
          later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for
          example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known
          as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy
          texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made'
          text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by
          typesetters since the 16th century.

        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <h2>All genuine Documentation at one place</h2>
        <p>
          Being Geeky helps the viewer to find all the required documentation at
          one place so that they need not waste time to find offical
          documentation. The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum',
          which is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is
          composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to
          'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient
          dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of
          most European languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin
          origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the
          text does not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's
          attention from the layout.

          made dummy text better known. While in earlier times several lines of
          the Lorem Ipsum text were repeated in the creation of dummy texts,
          today the full text of Cicero's 'De finibus' serves as the basis for
          many dummy text or Lorem Ipsum generators. Based on 'De finibus',
          these generators automatically create longer sections of the Lorem
          Ipsum text or various other filler texts.

          You can watch the lecture anytime from anywhere and ask doubts.The
          phrasal sequence of the Lorem Ipsum text is now so widespread and
          commonplace that many DTP programmes can generate dummy text using the
          starting sequence "Lorem ipsum". Fortunately, the phrase 'Lorem Ipsum'
          is now recognized by electronic pre-press systems and, when found, an
          alarm can be raised. This avoids a publication going to print with
          overlooked dummy text.

            You can apply different coupons to get extra discount on selected
            courses.Certain internet providers exploit the fact that fill text
            cannot be recognized by automatic search engines - meaningful
            information cannot be distinguished from meaningless:
            Target-generated dummy text mixed with a certain combination of
            search terms can lead to an increased frequency of visits by search
            machine users. As a consequence, advertising revenues, which rely on
            website 'hits', are increased.
